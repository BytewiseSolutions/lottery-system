              <p>Yes! When you win, you win real, spendable money. Every draw has a prize pool that grows based on entries, and winners receive payouts from that pool. Our system is designed to be fair, transparent, and reliable, and we take pride in honoring every legitimate win.</p>

              <p>The prize pool depends on how many total entries are received for a draw. For every single entry submitted, we allocate $0.001 to the pool. So, the more people play, the bigger the prize becomes. This model keeps the system sustainable while giving players the fun of watching the prize grow as the countdown to the draw gets closer.</p>
