              <h3>Our Unique Model</h3>
              <p>
                We operate on a unique model—players never pay to enter. Instead, our platform is funded entirely by advertising revenue. For every free entry submitted, we allocate $0.001 directly to the prize pool. This means the more people play, the bigger the winnings grow. With millions of entries, prize pools can reach impressive amounts, creating life-changing opportunities for our users.

              <h3>Fair & Simple</h3>
              <p>
                At TotalFreeLotto, fairness and simplicity are at the core of how we operate. Players choose 5 numbers and 2 bonus numbers from 99, and winners are those who successfully predict all winning numbers. We also host three live draws every week—on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday—streamed by our CEO through platforms like Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok to ensure openness and trust.

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>

As a bootstrapped startup, we are committed to growing responsibly, continuously improving the platform, and ensuring that free play always remains at the heart of what we do. Join us as we redefine what it means to play—and win—without spending a cent.
